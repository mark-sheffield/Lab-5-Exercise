# Lab-5-Exercise
This is the Lab-5 Exercise for Mark Sheffield and Ben Adams 
Our program takes 2 inputs, your name and your birthday, and compares it to today's date. If the month and days are equal, then it will wish you a happy birthday! If not, then it will let you know that your birthday is soon.
