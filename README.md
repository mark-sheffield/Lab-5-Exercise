# <h1>Birthday Comparison</h1>
<<<<<<<
This is the Lab-5 Exercise for Mark Sheffield and Ben Adams. The name of this program is Birthday Comparison. This program's purpose is to wish a user a happy birthday if it is their birthday. The program will prompt the user for their name and their birthday, and then check if the birthdate matches the current date. If it does, it will wish them a happy birthday. If not, it will reassure them that their birthday is coming up soon.

To run this program, download the github repository and unzip the folder to access the Notebook.ipynb file. You can run this in the command line if you have software that can run python files, or you can upload the file to JupyterHub and run it from there.
